# Roadmap

## Process

AMP follows a **time-based** release process. Until the project reaches v1.0,
we are currently releasing updates every two weeks.

## Roadmap

AMP roadmap items are filed on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/appcelerator/amp/issues)
with the [`roadmap`](https://github.com/appcelerator/amp/labels/roadmap) label.
They are open to community participation:

* Take a look at the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Join the [conversation](../README.md#join-the-conversation) with other users and contributors.
